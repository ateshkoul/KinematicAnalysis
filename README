This is a readme for the kinematic analysis package.
For the time being it contains functions in R for eye-tracking and Behavioral Data analysis but hopefully it would include a lot more implementations.


To install please use (in R command prompt):


install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ateshkoul/KinematicAnalysis")
